Project 1 - Inventory Management System
# Inventory Management System Project
The project is an inventory management system. In this I have provided a menu driven program
which runs till users choice .
The very first menu in the program tells the user to choose between admin and user.
If the the user chooses the admin option then the second menu appears which allows the user to choose between five options first option is for displaying the stocks , the second option is for adding items to the inventory , the third option is for removing items from the inventory, the fourth option is to display the ales report and the fifth option is to exit the program.
Similarly, if the user chooses option 2 from the first menu then the other menu comes up which has three options first one is to display the products the second option is to purchase the products and the third option is to exit the program
